# ripple-automata

An orchestrated cellular automata that follows the rules from Conway's Game of Life., with some variant. these variants are made for this to be an instalation piece that stays "alive" and active for extended periods of time, as well as grow and create patterns. The  age of each cells is tracked and represented by the intensity of its brightness. Different from Conway's Game of Life, once a cell lives for 100 iteration cycles it dies from old age and reproduces into five new surrounding cells. A sound is played upon death which is a random instrument with a weighted probability to make the sound more orchestrated. The cellular orchestra demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of randomness and the emergence from simple rules. Try it out and see what you can hear!

* click and drag to draw automata.

* press (n) for the normal mode.

* press (c) and wait to see an intricate pattern.

* press (s) for silence mode and to see the automata grow indefinitley.

* if the sound reverbs too much and glitches, exit the program and start again.
